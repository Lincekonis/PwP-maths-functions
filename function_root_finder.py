The function works like the Newton-Raphson method, but does not need the derivative. 
Instead it takes an input Îµ > 0. it loops iters times and should return the suggested value of x if f(x)
is within tol of zero, and None otherwise.

The bisection method of root finding works as follows. The input is two values a and b, with a < b,
such that one of {f(a),f(b)} is positive and the other is negative. Each iteration, either a or b is
replaced with the midpoint (a + b)/2 so that, after replacement, we still have one positive and one negative
value in {f (a), f (b)}

To use the bisection method, we need two numbers a and b such that f (a) and f (b) have different signs. 
Then, as long as f is continuous, f must have a root x between a and b.
