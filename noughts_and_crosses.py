Game of Noughts and Crosses

The board is represented as a string of length 9, made up of the characters
'o' (nought), 'x' (cross), and '.' (blank). The first 3 characters represent the top row, the next 3 the middle
row, and the last 3 the bottom row. For example, the string '..o.x....' represents the board on the right. You 
must use this representation exactly (e.g., donâ€™t use 'O' or '0' for nought, or ' ' for blank).
YOu can specify positions on the board using tuples of integers, indexed by row and then column,
starting at 0. So the board shown above has a nought in position (0,2) and a cross in position (1,1).
